**`AI Architect (Researcher/Developer/Hobbyist)`**

I'm a senior computer science student at the University of Kansas, where I've been studying machine learning and computer vision. I have strong object-oriented programming skills, primarily working with Python frameworks like PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Streamlit. Iâ€™ve built several full-stack web applications that incorporate AI features, such as image classification, sentiment classification, and retrieval-augmented generation. Additionally, I have 6 months of professional experience developing internal tooling for deep neural network training at ZeroEyes.

I am actively seeking job opportunities in the AI/ML/Tech space and I plan to graduate in May 2025.
